##Description
The Smart Village Water Management System is a technology-driven solution designed
to monitor and manage overhead water tanks in rural villages.  
This project uses C++ and Google maps for visualizing village water tank 
locations and water infrastructure on an interactive map.

The system helps local authorities and communities track water availability,
reduce wastage, and improve planning in water-scarce regions like Marathwada.

##Problem Statement
Many rural areas face severe water shortages due to:
--> Lack of real-time monitoring of water tanks.
--> Manual record keeping.
--> No location-based visualization of water sources.

##Solution 
This project provides:
- A menu driven C++ program to manage village water data
- Google Maps integration to display village locations
- Easy visualization of overhead water tanks
- Better decision making through data and maps.

##Features
- Add village details (name, tank capacity, usage)
- Track current water levels.
- Monitor daily water consumption.
- Display village locations on Google Maps.
- Open village location directly on map using latitude & longitude.
- Simple and user-friendly interface.

##Google Technologies Used
- Google Maps -: Authorities will get exact location of water tanks.
- Google Gemini
